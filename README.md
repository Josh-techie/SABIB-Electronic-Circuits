# SABIB-Electronic-Circuits

I will document my journey realizing the electronic circuit for the SABIB project here.

## Content:

- You can expect to find the necessayr libraries in **fzpz** that I used in my circuit. To be found in [Libraries-Fritzing](./Libraries-Fritzing/)
- Code implementation of each circuit to test
- Final Circuit where I merged all the test circuits into one big one üê¨

## Circuit Realized:

- I realized the circuit of Electric-Valve with ESP32, refer to [Electric-Valve-Command](./Electric-Valve-Command/)
- I realized the circuit of Electric Valve with Push Button, refer to [Electric-Valve-Push-Button](./Electric-Valve-Push-Button/)
